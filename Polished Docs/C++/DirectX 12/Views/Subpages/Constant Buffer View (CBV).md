# Constant Buffer View (CBV)

Constant buffers contain shader constant data. The value of them is that the data persists, and can be accessed by any GPU shader, until it is necessary to change the data.

A Constant Buffer View (CBV) is a view that correctly formats the constant buffer data for the GPU.

# Overview

The code is a minimal, self-contained example of a DirectX 12 application. It performs the following steps:

1.  Creates a window to render into.
2.  Initializes the core DirectX 12 components (device, command queue, swap chain).
3.  Sets up the rendering pipeline, including shaders and the pipeline state object (PSO).
4.  Creates a vertex buffer with the triangle's geometry.
5.  Enters a main loop that records and executes drawing commands.
6.  Cleans up resources on exit.

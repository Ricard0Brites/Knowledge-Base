# Directory Overview

This directory is a personal knowledge base, structured as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. It contains a collection of atomic, well-structured notes on various technical topics, primarily focused on software development and computer graphics.

Following a recent refactoring, the vault adheres to a consistent, hierarchical structure to ensure clarity and ease of navigation.

## Directory Structure

The organizational principle is based on nested topics. Each topic or sub-topic has its own directory containing an entry-point Markdown file that links to more granular notes.

The standard structure is as follows:

-   `Topic/`: The top-level folder for a subject (e.g., `C++`, `Design`).
-   `Topic/Topic.md`: The main entry-point file for the subject, linking to its sub-topics.
-   `Topic/Sub-Topic/`: A folder for a more specific area within the main topic.
-   `Topic/Sub-Topic/Sub-Topic.md`: The entry-point for the sub-topic.
-   `Topic/Sub-Topic/Subpages/`: (Optional) A folder holding the atomic notes for that sub-topic.

This system allows for deep, recursive organization of information.

## Key Files

The primary way to navigate this vault is through the main entry-point file in each top-level directory:

-   `C++/C++.md`: Entry-point for C++, DirectX, Win32, and language-specific notes.
-   `Design/Design.md`: Entry-point for software design patterns, OOP, and UML.
-   `Math/Math.md`: Entry-point for mathematical concepts like Matrices and Vectors.
-   `SSH/SSH.md`: Entry-point for notes on using SSH.

## Usage

This directory is intended for personal knowledge management. It is best used with a Markdown editor that supports `[[wiki-style]]` links, such as Obsidian. The content is designed to be a personal reference, with a focus on atomic notes that can be easily linked and cross-referenced.

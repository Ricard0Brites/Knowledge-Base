# Complex Number Addition

Given two complex numbers $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2i$, their sum is found by adding their real and imaginary parts separately:

$$ z_1 + z_2 = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)i $$

**Example:**
If $z_1 = 3 + 2i$ and $z_2 = 1 - 4i$:
$z_1 + z_2 = (3 + 1) + (2 - 4)i = 4 - 2i$

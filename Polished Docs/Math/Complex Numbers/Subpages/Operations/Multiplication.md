# Complex Number Multiplication

Given two complex numbers $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2i$, their product is found by using the distributive property, remembering that $i^2 = -1$:

$$ z_1 z_2 = (a_1 + b_1i)(a_2 + b_2i) = a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i + b_1a_2i + b_1b_2i^2 $$
$$ z_1 z_2 = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + b_1a_2)i $$

**Example:**
If $z_1 = 3 + 2i$ and $z_2 = 1 - 4i$:
$z_1 z_2 = (3 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot (-4)) + (3 \cdot (-4) + 2 \cdot 1)i$
$z_1 z_2 = (3 + 8) + (-12 + 2)i = 11 - 10i$

Multiplication is often simpler in [[Forms of Complex Numbers#2. Polar Form|Polar Form]]. If $z_1 = r_1 e^{i\theta_1}$ and $z_2 = r_2 e^{i\theta_2}$, then:
$$ z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)} $$

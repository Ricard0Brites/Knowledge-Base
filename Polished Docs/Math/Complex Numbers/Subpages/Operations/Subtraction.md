# Complex Number Subtraction

Given two complex numbers $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2i$, their difference is found by subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:

$$ z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)i $$

**Example:**
If $z_1 = 3 + 2i$ and $z_2 = 1 - 4i$:
$z_1 - z_2 = (3 - 1) + (2 - (-4))i = 2 + 6i$

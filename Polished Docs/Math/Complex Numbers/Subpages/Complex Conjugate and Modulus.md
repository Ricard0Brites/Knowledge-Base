# Complex Conjugate and Modulus

These are two fundamental properties of complex numbers that are crucial for various operations and analyses.

## Complex Conjugate

The complex conjugate of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is denoted as $\bar{z}$ (or $z^*$) and is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part:

$$ \bar{z} = a - bi $$

**Properties of the Complex Conjugate:**
*   $\overline{z_1 + z_2} = \bar{z_1} + \bar{z_2}$
*   $\overline{z_1 z_2} = \bar{z_1} \bar{z_2}$
*   $z \bar{z} = a^2 + b^2 = |z|^2$ (This is a real number)
*   If $z$ is a real number ($b=0$), then $\bar{z} = z$.

The conjugate is used in division of complex numbers to rationalize the denominator.

## Modulus (Magnitude)

The modulus (or magnitude or absolute value) of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is denoted as $|z|$ and represents the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane. It is calculated as:

$$ |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$

**Properties of the Modulus:**
*   $|z| \ge 0$
*   $|z| = 0$ if and only if $z = 0$.
*   $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2|$
*   $|\frac{z_1}{z_2}| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}$
*   $|z| = |\bar{z}|$
*   $|z|^2 = z \bar{z}$

# Overview of Complex Numbers

Complex numbers extend the concept of the one-dimensional real number line to a two-dimensional complex plane by incorporating the imaginary unit `i`, where $i^2 = -1$.

A complex number `z` is typically expressed in the form:

$$ z = a + bi $$

Where:
*   `a` is the real part of `z`
*   `b` is the imaginary part of `z`
*   `i` is the imaginary unit

Complex numbers are fundamental in various fields, including electrical engineering, physics, signal processing, and quantum mechanics, providing solutions to equations that have no real solutions.

# Polished Docs

This directory contains a collection of well-structured and refined notes, referred to as "Polished Docs". These documents are created by processing and enhancing raw information from "Quick Notes" using AI.

## Process: Quick Notes to Polished Docs

The workflow involves:
1.  **Quick Notes**: These are initial, often rough or unformatted, documents containing raw information, instructions, or concepts.
2.  **AI-Assisted Refinement**: Artificial intelligence tools are used to transform these quick notes into clear, concise, and well-organized "Polished Docs".
3.  **Placement**: The refined documents are then placed into their appropriate hierarchical locations within this `Polished Docs` directory.

### Updating Existing Notes

If a note in the `Quick Notes` directory has a corresponding, already polished version here, and the quick note contains new or updated information, the polished document is revised to incorporate the missing details in a clean, organized, and aesthetically pleasing manner.
